__Make sure you've read and understood the code style for the PR's__. The
changes that don't follow the code style will be _rejected_. Read
`README.md` in the `Source` folder for more details.

Make sure the PR, you're sending out, is expected by the maintainer(s). A
small fix of couple of lines can be simply sent out, but anything bigger
requires either an issue in the tracker, or the maintainers/authors
pre-approval.

_Always provide a brief description of the change and its impact to the
code._ If the change is not backwards compatible, it __must__ be explictly
pointed.
