# Documentation site for KSPDev Utils

This site holds documentation for several versions, since different versions of library can be used by different mods. It's highly encouraged to use the latest availabe version in development. However, the mod uses a legacy version and upgrading is not an option, the old documentation can help.

Verisons:

* [KSPDev Utils v1.0](v1.0)
