/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Naturally, KSP doesn't declare any part module interface (unfortunately), and all modder's
/// modules just inherit from <see cref="PartModule"/>. This interface is introduced for the better
/// OOP approach. It reveals methods that a regular module can override, and provides documentation
/// for each of them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Some methods of the module interface look familiar to the ones from Unity but they are not
/// behaving in the same way in every scene. Moreover, not all methods get called in every scene.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>In the <i>loading scene</i> the callbacks are executed in the following order:</para>
/// <list type="table">
/// <item>
/// <term><see cref="OnAwake"/></term>
/// <description>
/// Notifies about creating new module. If it's a clone operation then all <see cref="KSPField"/>
/// annotated fields have values from the part's config. Otherwise, all the fields are in the
/// initial states.
/// </description>
/// </item>
/// <item>
/// <term><see cref="OnLoad"/></term>
/// <description>
/// The provided config node is the original configuration from the part's definition. All the
/// annotated fields are populated before this method gets control.
