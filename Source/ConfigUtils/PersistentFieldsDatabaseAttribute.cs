/// Each <c>.cfg</c> file in the mod's folders is scanned and indexed by the game on start. The
/// data is stored in the database where it can be accessed from the game. The access is read-only,
/// any changes to the node returned from the database won't affect the database state.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The config file in the database is identified by a key which is made of three major parts:
/// <list type="">
/// <item>A file path relative to <c>GameData</c>. ATTENTION: the path must not contain "."!</item>
/// <item>The config filename without extension.</item>
/// <item>Node path inside the file starting from the root. I.e. the root node should have name as
/// well.</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// E.g. key <c>KIS/settings/KISConfig/Global</c> addresses a node <c>KISConfig/Global</c> in file
/// stored at <c>GameData/KIS/settings.cfg</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Special case is subfolders <c>PluginData</c>, they are ignored during database scan. Put
/// there configs that can change during the gameplay. Remember, that even a tiny change in the
/// config will trigger database re-compilation on the next start which may significantly impact
/// game loading time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Database is actively used by
/// <see href="https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager">ModuleManager</see> (a.k.a. MM). Be wise
/// when choosing if the fields should be read from a file or from the database. The module manager
/// patches are only applied on the database, they don't affect the config files. E.g. if the part
/// config is expected to be a target of the MM patches but never updated from the gameplay, then
/// reading id via the database is the best choice. However, various mod's settings, that change
/// during the game, will unlikely be a target for a MM patch - put the config into
/// <c>PluginData</c> and read it as a file.
