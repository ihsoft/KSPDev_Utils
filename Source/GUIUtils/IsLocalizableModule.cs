/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>
/// KSP events, actions or fields that are attributed with <see cref="LocalizableItemAttribute"/>.
/// The module would want to call the <see cref="LocalizationLoader.LoadItemsInModule"/> method to
/// have the strings updated.
/// </item>
/// <item>Cached strings. The module would want to refresh the cache.</item>
/// <item>
/// Dynamically created part menu items. The module would want to recreate them. If that's the case
/// it's always better to implement <see cref="IHasContextMenu"/>, and then just call the update
/// method.
/// </item>
