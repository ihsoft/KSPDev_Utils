/// <summary>A helper to accumulate GUI actions.</summary>
/// <remarks>Unity may issue multiple GUI passes during a frame, and it requires the number of UI
/// elements not to change between the passes. Unity expects the number of UI
/// controls in every pass to be exactly the same as in the very first one:
/// <see href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EventType.Layout.html">EventType.Layout</see>.
/// When the UI interactions affect the representation, all the changes must be postponed till the
/// frame rendering is ended. This helper can be used to store the actions that will be executed at
/// the beginning of the next frame.</remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// public class MyUI : MonoBehaviour {
///   private readonly GuiActionsList guiActions = new GuiActionsList();
///   private bool showLabel = false;
///
///   void OnGUI() {
///     if (guiActions.ExecutePendingGuiActions()) {
///       // ...do other stuff that affects UI... 
///     }
///
///     if (GUILayout.Button(new GUIContent("Test Button"))) {
///       // If "showLabel" is changed right here then Unity GUI will complain saying the number
///       // of UI controls has changed. So, postpone the change until current frame is ended.
///       guiActions.Add(() => {
///         showLabel = !showLabel;  // This will be done at the beginning of the next frame.
///       });
///     }
///     
///     if (showLabel) {
///       GUILayout.Label("Test label");
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// </code>
/// <para>If you were using simple approach and updated <c>showLabel</c> right away Unity would
/// likely thrown an error like this:</para>
/// <para><c>[EXCEPTION] ArgumentException: Getting control 1's position in a group with only 1
/// controls when doing Repaint</c></para>
