/// doesn't have this drawback. Moreover, it can tell if the window is being dragged, so that the
/// code could postpone the layout update until the dragging is over.

  /// The main difference from the stock method is that the dragging state is not reset by the GUI
  /// layout methods. Also, it reports the draggign state, so some updates to the dialog may be
  /// frozen to not inerfere with the move operation.
